# Garbage image classification
As part of the Deep Learning for AI course, I developed a computer vision project focused on the classification of garbage images using convolutional neural networks.
The objective was to automatically recognise different waste categories from images, addressing a real-world classification problem through deep learning techniques.

I designed and trained CNN-based models, applying data preprocessing and augmentation strategies to improve generalisation performance.
Model evaluation was carried out using standard classification metrics, with particular attention to training–test behaviour, overfitting, and class-level errors.
The project highlights both the potential and the limitations of deep learning models when applied to noisy, visually similar image classes.

## File description

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with the complete workflow, including data loading, preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation.

## How to run
- Install Python and the required libraries (e.g. PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib).
- Clone this repository or download the notebook.
- Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
- Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the experiments and results.
  
## Output
The notebook includes training logs, evaluation metrics, and visual outputs that illustrate model performance and classification behaviour across different garbage categories.

## Model comparison and training journey
Alongside the notebook, the repository includes a presentation that summarises the training journey of the two models, highlighting architectural choices, optimisation strategies, and performance trade-offs. The slides provide a high-level view of the experimental process and complement the detailed code-based analysis.
